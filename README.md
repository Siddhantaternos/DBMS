## 📘 DBMS & Data Systems — Notes Repository

This repository documents my structured learning of **Database Management Systems (DBMS)** with a strong emphasis on **fundamentals, system thinking, and real-world relevance**.

The notes are designed to bridge the gap between **theoretical concepts** (like data modeling and normalization) and **practical industry usage** (how databases are actually designed, queried, and optimized in production systems). Instead of rote definitions, the focus is on **why concepts exist, how they are applied, and what trade-offs they introduce**.

These notes are:

* Written with **interviews and real systems** in mind
* Organized for **long-term reference**, not short-term exams
* Suitable for **beginners**, yet deep enough for **technical discussions**

This repository also reflects my progression toward **backend, data, and system-oriented roles**, and is continuously expanded as my understanding grows.

## 🧭 Repository Roadmap

The notes in this repository follow a deliberate learning path:
  
```
Data Basics
   ↓
Entity–Relationship (ER) Modeling
   ↓
Relational Model & Schema Design
   ↓
Keys, Constraints & Integrity
   ↓
Normalization & Design Trade-offs
   ↓
SQL (Queries, Joins, Subqueries)
   ↓
Indexing & Query Optimization
   ↓
Transactions, ACID & Concurrency
   ↓
Storage, Data Centers & System Internals
   ↓
Interview Patterns & Real-World Scenarios
```

Each section builds on the previous one to develop **clear mental models**, not just surface-level knowledge.

## 👤 Author Note

I’m a student focused on **data structures, databases, and system fundamentals**, with an interest in building **scalable, data-driven applications**.
This repository serves as both my **learning archive** and a **public knowledge base** for anyone aiming to strengthen their DBMS foundations.
